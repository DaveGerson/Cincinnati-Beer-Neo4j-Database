Cincinnati Beer: Neo4j Database
==============================

This file contains the database, .ppt, and querybooks for my exploration into graph databases. 

The data database included was the implemented based on menus from local restaurants and breweries.  It is in its initial stage but even using the community distribution it can scale much futher.  

My Neo4j query book has queries that explain and perform traversal functions, showing how this method of data persistence differs from common data anlysis techniques.


Future plans would be to implement a "social component" to this database which would allow for model training.
